# Personal Code Notes, Recipes, and Research

Feel free to look around. This is not comprehensive, just a bunch of
random notes as I experiment and discover different things, sort of like
a repo full of Gists.

* [Smallest Docker Go Image](docker/go/smallest)
* [Smallest Docker Go Image(without Go)](docker/go/smallest-nogo)
* [Experimenting with Go Contexts](go/context)
* [Go SQLite Notes](go/sqlite)

## Caveats

* This is one of the few repos where I commit directly to `main`
